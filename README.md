# 👋🏽 Hi, I’m Christina Cephus (a.k.a. @thecephus)
![20250405_2211_Image Generation_remix_01jr4dvp0neqrsagy3j0b46hzp](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8c3e4e92-f070-4b42-9871-173f7f33b372)

🗽 NYC-based software developer with a mission to **bring AI into the physical world** — from automating machines to reimagining how we interact with intelligent systems.

### 🌱 Current Journey
- Recently wrapped up my time as a **Backend Engineer (L3)** in Uber’s **Boost Fellowship Program**, where I worked on backend system migrations, data gateways, and experimentation infrastructure in Go, Python, and SQL.
- Now deeply immersed in **Python**, **AI development**, **cybersecurity**, and **data engineering** — building small but powerful tools to level up and refine my technical stack.
- Experimenting with everything from **prompt-engineered agents** to **AI-driven automation for physical systems**.
- Long-term goal: **build scalable, secure AI infrastructure** for robotics, decentralized networks, and real-world applications.

### 🛠️ Tech Stack I'm Loving Right Now
- **Languages**: Python, Go, SQL, Bash
- **Infra & Tooling**: Docker, GitHub Actions, Terraform, Postgres, Kafka
- **AI/ML**: LangChain, OpenAI API, Hugging Face, Whisper
- **Security**: Working on skills in auth flows, encrypted comms, and secure design
- **Data**: ETL pipelines, Snowflake, dbt (learning!)

### 🌐 What I'm Building Toward
I'm not just coding—I’m prototyping the future. I care deeply about:
- Making advanced technology **accessible and equitable**
- Designing systems that **learn, adapt, and act in the real world**
- Using AI responsibly to **empower communities**, not exploit them

### 🤝🏽 Let’s Collaborate
If you're into:
- AI for real-world automation
- Ethical system design
- Open-source tooling for resilience and privacy

📫 Reach out or follow along. I’m building in public, learning out loud, and always down to connect with forward-thinkers.
